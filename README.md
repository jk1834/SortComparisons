# SortComparisons
This project compares basic forms of selection and merge sort and compares their 'crossover point'. Using this crossover point, I was able to make a hybrid sorting algorithm that, on average, runs faster than both of them.

Below is the graph that shows where the crossover point is using the average runtime for each different size of array, from size 3 to 199.
